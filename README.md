# blade-bot

Quick bot script for posting Blades in the Dark generated stuff.  Not
really very specifically Blades in the Dark.  The output is currently 
at https://twitter.com/doskvolscores.

Stuff I used:

* Kate Compton's [Tracery](https://tracery.io/)
** Allison Parrish's awesome [pytracery](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) port of Tracery
* [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org), which is nice and simple
